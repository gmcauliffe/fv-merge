# FV Merge Project

The FirstVoices archive contains some duplicate words. Language recorders require an easy, interactive way to be guided through merging two-word entries into a single entry. 

This is a simple component currently under construction to address that problem. It will allow language recorders to merge two-word entries, based on a sample json end-point provided.
